Introduction to Mission Planner
===============================

First Steps
------------
  **The default refresh rates of MP are fairly slow and undesirable for live updates during flight operations.**

  To adjust this navigate to the **CONFIG** tab
  - In the lefthand navigation pane select **Planner**
  - You will be modifying the *Telemetry Rates* parameters as follows
    - Altitude: **100**
    - Position:  **100**
    - Mode/Status:  **100**
    - RC:  **100**
    - Sensor:  **100**

  **While you are in this page I recommend the following changes:**
    - Dist Units: **Personal preference**
    - Alt Units: **Feet** - Since operating restrictions are given in feet this is best to leave in feet to ensure you are operating within legal limits
    - Speed Units: **Personal preference** - meters_per_second or mph are recommended

    - Map Follow: **Not enabled**

    - Theme: **HighContrast.mpsystheme** - Easiest to see on a screen in direct sunlight

    - Layout: **Advanced**

    - Running on a slow computer: **Unchecked initially** - You may opt to enable this if you are having performance issues with MP during operations
