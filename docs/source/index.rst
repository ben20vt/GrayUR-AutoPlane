Welcome to the GRAYUR Autoplane documentation!
===================================

Project Description
--------
Aerial surveying involves flying repeatedly over the area of interest while taking photographs.
These photos can then be combined into a composite image and various post-processing
techniques can be applied to highlight patterns and collect data. These surveys have the potential
to increase safety and efficiency in a variety of fields, though their use is often limited by
expensive equipment and software. The goal of AutoPlane is to overcome the cost and
accessibility barriers associated with aerial surveying by designing a low-cost, autonomous air
vehicle capable of flying survey missions and processing the collected images using freely
available software. The drone will fly a grid pattern to survey areas of interest, and the images
collected will be used to generate orthomosaic photos, slope models, and subsequently perform
tree segmentation using computer algorithms. Potential applications of this data include
evaluating the risk of forest fires, determining forest health, and monitoring invasive species.
