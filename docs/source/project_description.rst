Project Overview
*****************
Aerial surveying involves flying repeatedly over the area of interest while taking photographs.
These photos can then be combined into a composite image and various post-processing
techniques can be applied to highlight patterns and collect data. These surveys have the potential
to increase safety and efficiency in a variety of fields, though their use is often limited by
expensive equipment and software. The goal of AutoPlane is to overcome the cost and
accessibility barriers associated with aerial surveying by designing a low-cost, autonomous air
vehicle capable of flying survey missions and processing the collected images using freely
available software. The drone will fly a grid pattern to survey areas of interest, and the images
collected will be used to generate orthomosaic photos, slope models, and subsequently perform
tree segmentation using computer algorithms. Potential applications of this data include
evaluating the risk of forest fires, determining forest health, and monitoring invasive species.

Objectives
***********
#. Fly MK IV Airframe
#. Capture high-quality image data sets
#. Demonstrate classification algorithm
#. Secure new research partners

Major Tasks
************
The major tasks of the project are outlined below. These are nominal and are likely to change
somewhat throughout the course of the year. These are meant to illustrate the general nature of
the work that the position entails.

	1. MK.IV Preliminary Design and Budget (airframe Team)
	2. MK.IV Airframe construction
	3. Flight Control Setup and Ground Testing
	4. Flight testing
	5. Crosstrain current and new members
	6. Optimize image collection to plan for algorithm development (Image Processing Team)
	7. Implement semi autonomous waypoint missions
	8. Feature extraction using video processing
	9. Build and integrate stabilization rig for the onboard camera

General Responsibilities of the Group	
************************************************
Students participating in the GrayUR undergraduate research group will register for an ENGE
2994 or ENGE 4994 undergraduate research course. Typically, students enroll for a 1 credit-
hour course load. Under certain circumstances, we can look at extending this up to as many as 3
credits per semester and can sometimes explore technical elective credit within your major.

Though not required, the expectation is that you will continue on with the team for two
semesters, though we will examine the relationship at the end of the fall semester.

In addition to the major technical tasks listed above, all members of the GrayUR undergraduate
research team should expect
- To devote ~3 hours/week to research for each credit hour
- To attend a biweekly team meeting with Dr. Gray
- To attend a monthly all-hands meeting with Dr. Gray
- To participate in periodic reporting (symposia, research poster sessions, etc.)

Major Deliverables
*******************
All student teams will have the following deliverables
- One progress presentation to the entire GrayUR group each semester
- Year-end presentation at the Office of Undergraduate Research Symposium
- Final project reporting
	- Final report
	- Final slides
	- Final personal reflection
